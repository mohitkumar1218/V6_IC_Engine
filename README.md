# V6_IC_Engine
I completed a design project involving a V6 Internal Combustion (IC) engine using SolidWorks. 
This project encompassed the detailed modeling and assembly of the V6 Internal Combustion engine. 
This project taught me practical experience in 3D modeling, assembly, and engineering design principles.
